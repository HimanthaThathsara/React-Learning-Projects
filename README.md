##  Overview

<code>This repository is a learning collection of React-based projects and components. It contains multiple standalone example apps and UI component implementations created while learning React and front-end development. The code demonstrates practical use of React (JSX), component composition, styling with CSS, and simple build/run configurations. Notable directories include examples such as a portfolio project, a crypto API UI example, clones of landing pages, and single-page demos. The intent is educational: to experiment, iterate, and showcase small real-world UI patterns.</code>

---

##  Features

<code>
- Multiple small React applications and example projects for learning and demonstration.
- Reusable UI components and layouts (JSX + CSS) that illustrate component composition and responsive styling.
- Example projects visible in the repository (for example: portfolio apps, a crypto API UI example, and landing-page clones).
- Simple local development flow using npm for installing dependencies and running projects.
- Organized examples that are easy to fork, inspect, and adapt for practice or portfolio work.</code>
